# My Scala Link Shortener

## Build & Run

This is primarily for testing

```sh
$ cd My_Scala_Link_Shortener
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.



# Build and Deploy with Docker
