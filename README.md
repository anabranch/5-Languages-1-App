#Link Shortener on the JVM

Writing a Link shortener in several different languages.

The Languages:
- Clojure
- Scala

The Requirements:
- Unit Testing
- Redis Backend
- Docker Deployment (across containers)

This is a description of my experience doing so.

*language itself, libraries, testing, time required, deploying, dependency management, building the project*

Check the other readme files to see write ups for each language.
